## Build

`npm run build`

See [./build/README.md](https://github.com/thysultan/dio.js/tree/master/build) for more information on how it works.

## Running Tests

[See ./tests](https://github.com/thysultan/dio.js/tree/master/tests). 100% test coverage is a work in progress. PR's for tests are welcome.

## Code Suggestions

* Use semicolons `;`
* Tabs
* Prefer `'` over `"`

```javascript
// this...
function name () {

}

// ...not this
function name(){

}
// this makes it easier to search for
// name () to find where the function is
// declared and name() for where the function
// is used
```
